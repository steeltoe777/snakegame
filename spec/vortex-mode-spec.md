## [x] 1. Concept & Validation

### Problem Statement
As players progress to higher levels, collecting all pellets becomes increasingly difficult due to complex mazes, mushroom obstacles, and the snake's own trail. Players need a strategic tool to assist with pellet collection without completely removing the challenge.

### Core Concept
Implement a 'Vortex Mode' power-up that appears as a swirling galaxy icon. When collected, it activates a temporary gravitational pull that attracts nearby pellets toward the snake's head for a limited duration, making pellet collection significantly easier.

### Value Proposition
- Adds a new dimension to the power-up system (attraction/gravity manipulation)
- Provides strategic assistance with pellet collection in complex scenarios
- Enhances visual appeal with particle effects and animations
- Complements existing power-ups without being overpowered
- Maintains game balance by having a limited duration

### Competitive Analysis
Most snake games don't offer pellet attraction mechanics. This feature is more commonly found in games like Pac-Man with power pellets. However, implementing it as a temporary power-up rather than a permanent state makes it more balanced and strategic.

### Critical Risks
- Could become overpowered if attraction radius is too large
- Might reduce game challenge if duration is too long
- Could conflict visually with existing particle effects
- May impact performance with complex attraction calculations

### Mitigation Strategies
- Limit attraction radius to 5-7 tiles
- Set duration to 5-7 seconds
- Use efficient distance calculations
- Implement distinct visual styling

### Assumptions
- Players will appreciate assistance with pellet collection in higher levels
- Technical implementation is feasible within current game architecture
- Performance impact will be minimal with optimized calculations
- Visual indicators will be clear and intuitive

**Gate**: [x] Ready for feasibility

## [x] 2. Feasibility & Priority

### Technical Feasibility
Implementation is straightforward using existing game mechanics:
- Leverage existing power-up spawn/detection system
- Use distance calculations for pellet attraction
- Apply velocity adjustments to attracted pellets
- Integrate with existing game state management

### Resource Estimates
- Development time: 3-4 hours
- Testing time: 1-2 hours
- Complexity: Medium

### Dependencies
- Existing power-up system
- Pellet management system
- Game loop and rendering system
- Canvas drawing capabilities

### Strategic Alignment
This feature aligns with the game's innovative approach to snake gameplay by adding a unique mechanic not found in traditional snake games. It enhances the strategic depth while maintaining the core challenge.

### Priority Justification
High priority as it addresses a genuine gameplay pain point (pellet collection difficulty) while adding visual spectacle and strategic depth.

**Gate**: [x] Proceed

## [x] 3. Architecture & Planning

### Architectural Approach
Integrate vortex mode as a new power-up type within the existing power-up system:
1. Add vortex power-up to spawn pool
2. Implement attraction logic in game loop
3. Add visual effects for vortex activation
4. Manage duration and state transitions

### System Components
- Power-up spawner: Add vortex to rotation
- Game state manager: Track vortex activation
- Physics system: Calculate pellet attraction
- Renderer: Display visual effects

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope:**
- Vortex power-up spawning
- Pellet attraction mechanics
- Visual effects and animations
- Duration management

**Out of Scope:**
- Attracting other game objects (mushrooms, walls)
- Permanent vortex mode
- Multi-level attraction strength

### Requirements
1. Vortex power-up spawns with same frequency as other power-ups
2. Attraction radius: 6 tiles
3. Duration: 6 seconds
4. Visual indicator during activation
5. Distinct appearance from other power-ups

### Implementation Plan
1. Phase 1: Add vortex power-up to spawn system
2. Phase 2: Implement attraction mechanics
3. Phase 3: Add visual effects
4. Phase 4: Integrate with game state and duration management

**Gate**: [x] Planning complete
