## [ ] 1. Concept & Validation

### Problem Statement
Players face increasing difficulty with complex mazes and trail collisions, but lack a mechanism to overcome these obstacles strategically. The game needs a balanced power-up that provides temporary relief from collision constraints without breaking game balance.

### Core Concept
Ghost Mode power-up that temporarily allows the snake to phase through walls and its own trail for a limited duration, providing strategic options during difficult moments.

### Competitive Analysis
Other snake games typically offer simple speed boosts or size reductions. This feature adds a unique dimension by temporarily removing collision constraints, similar to classic arcade power-ups like Pac-Man's power pellets.

### Critical Risks
- Overpowered if duration is too long
- Underpowered if duration is too short
- Visual confusion with existing power-ups

### Mitigation Strategies
- Balanced timing (3-5 seconds)
- Distinct visual indicator
- Cooldown period between uses

### Assumptions
- Players understand the strategic value of temporary collision immunity
- Visual cues clearly indicate when Ghost Mode is active

## [ ] 2. Feasibility & Priority

### Technical Feasibility
High - Similar to existing power-up implementations with timer-based activation

### Resource Estimates
- Development: 4-6 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour

### Dependencies
Existing collision detection system and power-up framework

### Strategic Alignment
Enhances core gameplay loop by adding strategic depth without changing fundamental mechanics

### Priority Justification
Medium priority - Enhances player experience without critical path dependency

## [ ] 3. Architecture & Planning

### Architectural Approach
Integrate with existing power-up system using timer-based activation pattern

### System Components
1. Ghost Mode item generator
2. Collision detection override when active
3. Visual indicator for active state
4. Timer display for remaining duration

### Scope Boundaries
IN: Temporary collision immunity, visual feedback, timer display
OUT: Permanent state changes, score multipliers, snake modifications

### Requirements
- Generate Ghost Mode items periodically
- Override collision detection when active
- Provide clear visual feedback
- Limit duration to 3-5 seconds

### Implementation Plan
1. Add Ghost Mode item generation
2. Implement collision override logic
3. Create visual feedback system
4. Add timer display
5. Integrate with existing power-up framework

## [ ] 4. Implementation

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Add ghostModeActive flag to gameState
- [ ] Create generateGhostModeItems function
- [ ] Implement drawGhostModeItems function
- [ ] Verify: Item generation works without errors
- [ ] Backup: Git commit before changes

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Modify collision detection to respect ghostModeActive
- [ ] Implement ghost mode timer and activation
- [ ] Add visual feedback for active ghost mode
- [ ] Verify: Snake can pass through walls/trail when active
- [ ] Document: Changes with version notes

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- [ ] Add timer display for ghost mode duration
- [ ] Implement sound effects (if audio system exists)
- [ ] Verify: Timer display updates correctly
- [ ] Update: Documentation with usage instructions

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Test ghost mode activation and deactivation
- [ ] Validate collision override functionality
- [ ] Verify all existing tests still pass
- [ ] Archive: Spec version with release notes

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Considerations

### Comparative Analysis
| Feature | Current | Proposed | Impact |
|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| Collision | Always active | Temporarily disabled | Strategic gameplay |
| Duration | N/A | 3-5 seconds | Balanced risk/reward |
| Frequency | N/A | Per-level appearance | Consistent availability |

### Trade-offs
- [ ] **Trade-off 1**: Temporary invincibility vs. game challenge - Pros: Strategic gameplay, Cons: Potential for abuse
- [ ] **Trade-off 2**: Visual complexity vs. clarity - Pros: Rich feedback, Cons: Screen clutter

## üîß Best Practices

### Pattern Consistency
- Follow existing power-up implementation patterns
- Use same timer display approach as other power-ups
- Maintain consistent item generation logic

### Git Integration
- Reference latest commit before changes: 08bd57d
- Use feature branches for experimental work
- Use `git restore` for rollbacks instead of backup files

### Incremental Validation
- Test item generation separately
- Validate collision override independently
- Verify integration with existing power-ups

### System Integration
- Map functionality to existing power-up hooks
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Document API changes with versioning

### Code Quality
- Follow existing JavaScript style in script.js
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Include inline documentation for ghost mode logic

## üìä Success Metrics
- [ ] **Performance**: Frame rate maintained at 60 FPS with ghost mode active
- [ ] **Reliability**: Ghost mode activates/deactivates correctly 100% of the time
- [ ] **Quality**: No visual artifacts or collision detection errors
- [ ] **User Satisfaction**: Player testing shows improved strategic options
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Code follows existing patterns and is well-documented
