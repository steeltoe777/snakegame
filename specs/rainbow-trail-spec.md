### 4. Feature Requirements

#### Core Functionality
- The snake's trail should display a rainbow effect that cycles through colors
- The effect should be smooth and visually pleasing
- The effect should not impact game performance
- The effect should not interfere with gameplay or visibility

#### Technical Specifications

##### System Components
- drawTrail() function in script.js
- gameState object (for storing hue value)
- HTML5 Canvas rendering context

##### Code Properties
```javascript
gameState.rainbowHue: number,      // Current hue value for rainbow effect (0-360)
```

##### Implementation Logic
// 1. Initialize rainbowHue in gameState

// 3. Convert HSL hue value to RGB for trail segment coloring
// 4. Apply color to each trail segment with slight variation for visual effect

##### Integration Points
- Existing drawTrail() function
- Main game update loop
