# GameState Initialization Fix Specification

## Problem Statement
The script.js file has a runtime error: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'gameInterval')" at line 884 in resetGame() function. This occurs because window.gameState is being accessed before it's properly initialized.

## Root Cause Analysis
- window.gameState is defined at line 183 but only exposed to window at line 1014
- Functions like generateMushrooms() (line 5) immediately try to access window.gameState (line 6)
- Function definitions are hoisted, but function bodies execute when called
- The functions are called before window.gameState is properly initialized

## Current State
- **File**: /a0/projects/snakegame/script.js
- **Lines**: 1267
- **Git Reference**: $(git log --oneline -1)
- **Tests**: 17 failed, 8 passed out of 25 total (due to environment setup)
- **Functionality**: Game works in browser but has initialization race condition
- **Dependencies**: All game functions depend on window.gameState
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-18 22:59:05

## Solution Approach
Move the gameState initialization to the top of the file before any function definitions that use it.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Move gameState object definition from line 183 to top of file
- [ ] Expose window.gameState immediately after definition
- [ ] Ensure all function definitions come after gameState initialization

### Phase 2: Validation
- [ ] Run linting to ensure syntax correctness
- [ ] Test in browser environment
- [ ] Verify no runtime errors

### Phase 3: Testing
- [ ] Run test suite to check for regressions
- [ ] Verify all existing functionality works

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Code Quality: No syntax errors, proper formatting
- [ ] Functionality: Game runs without initialization errors
- [ ] Performance: No performance regression
- [ ] Security: No new security vulnerabilities

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Runtime Error: Eliminated "Cannot read properties of undefined" error
- [ ] Test Results: All tests should pass (environment permitting)
- [ ] Browser Compatibility: Game works in all supported browsers

## Risk Mitigation
- [ ] Backup: Use git for version control
- [ ] Rollback: git restore if issues occur
- [ ] Testing: Comprehensive browser testing
