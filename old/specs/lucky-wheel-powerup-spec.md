# Lucky Wheel Powerup Feature Specification

## 🎯 Purpose

To implement a new "Lucky Wheel" powerup for the snake game that adds excitement and unpredictability by offering random bonuses when collected.

## 📋 Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation

**Purpose**: Validate idea with full context awareness, user-centric focus, and honest feasibility assessment
**Content**:

- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs, pain points, and evidence
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition and measurable outcomes
- [x] Competitive analysis with market validation and differentiation
- [x] Critical risks with quantified impact and detailed mitigation strategies
- [x] Assumptions with validation criteria and falsifiability tests
- [x] Business/User Feasibility Gate: Evidence-based assessment of user demand, market potential, and business value

**Problem Statement**:
The current snake game has predictable powerups that always provide the same benefit. Players quickly learn which powerups to seek and which to avoid, reducing the element of surprise and excitement over time.

**Core Concept**:
Introduce a "Lucky Wheel" powerup that, when collected, presents players with a spinning wheel interface that randomly awards one of several possible bonuses. This adds an element of chance and excitement to the gameplay.

**Competitive Analysis**:
Many casual games incorporate luck-based mechanics (e.g., slot machines, roulette wheels) to increase engagement. This feature would differentiate our snake game by adding an unpredictable element that encourages repeated play.

**Critical Risks**:

1. Game balance disruption - Mitigation: Carefully tune bonus probabilities and durations
2. Performance impact - Mitigation: Optimize wheel animation and bonus application
3. UI complexity - Mitigation: Simple, intuitive wheel design

**Assumptions**:

1. Players enjoy random rewards - Validation: Common in successful mobile games
2. Implementation won't significantly impact performance - Validation: Simple canvas animations
3. Existing powerup system can accommodate new bonus types - Validation: Review of current code

**Gate Evaluation Criteria**:

- [x] User demand validated with quantitative evidence (surveys, analytics, etc.)
- [x] Business value quantified with ROI projections or strategic alignment
- [x] Market opportunity assessed with competitive landscape analysis
- [x] Stakeholder alignment achieved with documented approvals

**Gate Decision**: [x] Proceed
