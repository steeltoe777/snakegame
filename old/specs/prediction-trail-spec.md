# Prediction Trail Feature Specification

## 🎯 Concept & Validation

### Problem Statement
Players often struggle with planning moves in tight spaces or complex maze layouts because they cannot easily visualize where the snake will move in the next few steps. This leads to accidental collisions with walls or the snake's own body.

### Core Concept
Implement a "Prediction Trail" that visually shows where the snake will travel for the next 3-5 moves based on its current direction. This predictive visualization helps players anticipate future positions and plan accordingly.

### Value Proposition
- Enhances player decision-making in complex situations
- Reduces accidental collisions by improving spatial awareness
- Adds a helpful visualization without changing gameplay mechanics
- Complements existing maze and power-up systems
- Improves accessibility for new players

### Critical Risks
- May clutter the visual interface if not designed carefully
- Could be distracting for experienced players
- Might reveal too much information, reducing challenge
- Performance impact with frequent position calculations
- Color choices may conflict with existing visual elements

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use subtle, semi-transparent visuals that don't overpower the game
- Make the feature toggleable for player preference
- Limit prediction to a reasonable number of steps (3-5)
- Optimize calculation algorithms for performance
- Choose colors that complement rather than clash with existing palette

### Assumptions
- Players will appreciate visual assistance with move planning
- Technical implementation is feasible within current architecture
- Performance impact will be minimal with proper optimization
- Visual design can clearly communicate predicted path without distraction
- Feature can be implemented without disrupting existing gameplay
