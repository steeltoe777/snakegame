# Smart Pellet Indicator Specification

## 🎯 Purpose
Implement a 'Smart Pellet Indicator' power-up that highlights the closest pellet to the snake's head with a distinct visual indicator. The indicator dynamically updates as the snake moves and lasts for 15 seconds.

## 📋 Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation
**Purpose**: Validate idea with full context awareness and user-centric focus
**Content**:
- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs and pain points
Players often struggle to quickly identify the nearest pellet, especially in complex maze layouts or when the snake is long. This leads to inefficient navigation and slower completion times.

- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition
A temporary power-up that highlights the closest pellet to the snake's head with a distinct visual indicator. The indicator dynamically updates as the snake moves, helping players navigate more efficiently.

- [x] Competitive analysis or alternative solutions
Other power-ups provide tactical advantages (speed, protection, attraction) but none offer direct navigation assistance. This fills a gap in player assistance without being overpowered.

- [x] Critical risks with mitigation strategies
Risk: Overpowered if too frequent or long-lasting. Mitigation: Low spawn rate and moderate duration (15 seconds).
Risk: Visual distraction from normal gameplay. Mitigation: Distinct but not obtrusive visual design.

- [x] Assumptions with validation criteria
Assumption: Players will find navigation assistance useful. Validation: Test with various maze complexities.
Assumption: Feature won't unbalance game progression. Validation: Monitor level completion rates.

**Gate**: [x] Ready for feasibility
