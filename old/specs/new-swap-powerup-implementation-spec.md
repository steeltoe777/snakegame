# New Swap Powerup Implementation Specification

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State
- **File**: /a0/projects/snakegame/script.js
- **Git Reference**: bfc0936 updated docs.
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-21 16:53:17

## ðŸ“‹ Issue Description
The current swap powerup implementation needs to be completely redesigned based on new requirements:
1. The swap should happen automatically when eating the orb, not when pressing spacebar
2. The snake should have invulnerability during a cooldown period
3. During this period, the snake can pass over obstacles and its own body to establish a new route
4. The snake head should pop out from the Tron trail
5. The new direction should be opposite to the direction of the last two segments of the Tron trail

## âœ… New Implementation Plan

### Core Functionality
When the snake eats a swap orb:
1. The snake enters a "swap mode" for a defined duration (e.g., 5 seconds)
2. During this time, the snake is invulnerable to collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body
3. The snake can move through these obstacles to establish a new route
4. At the end of the swap mode:
   - The snake head pops out from the Tron trail at the current position
   - The new direction is calculated as opposite to the direction of the last two segments of the Tron trail
   - The snake continues moving in this new direction

### Technical Approach
1. Modify the swap orb collection logic to activate swap mode instead of the current powerup
2. Implement invulnerability during swap mode
3. Allow movement through obstacles during swap mode
4. Implement the "pop out" mechanism at the end of swap mode
5. Calculate the new direction based on the Tron trail

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Swap mode activates automatically when orb is collected
- [ ] Visual indicator shows when swap mode is active
- [ ] Snake is invulnerable during swap mode
- [ ] Snake can pass through walls, obstacles, and its own body during swap mode
- [ ] At the end of swap mode, snake head pops out from the Tron trail
- [ ] New direction is opposite to the direction of the last two segments of the Tron trail
- [ ] Code passes linting and testing

## ðŸš€ Implementation Details

### 1. Swap Mode Activation
When a swap orb is collected:
- Set `gameState.swapModeActive = true`
- Set `gameState.swapModeTimer = 5000` (5 seconds)
- Set `gameState.swapModeLastUpdate = performance.now()`
- Update visual indicators

### 2. Invulnerability During Swap Mode
During swap mode:
- Skip collision detection with walls, obstacles, and snake body
- Continue normal movement logic

### 3. Pop Out Mechanism
At the end of swap mode:
- Calculate new direction based on last two segments of Tron trail
- Position snake head at current location
- Clear the portion of the trail that was used to establish the new route
- Set snake direction to the calculated opposite direction

### 4. Direction Calculation
To calculate the new direction:
- Get the last two segments of the Tron trail
- Determine the direction vector between them
- Set the snake's new direction to the opposite of this vector

### Changes Required
1. Modify swap orb collection logic in `update()` function
2. Add swap mode state variables to `gameState`
3. Implement invulnerability logic in collision detection
4. Implement pop out mechanism
5. Implement direction calculation
6. Update visual indicators


## âœ… Implementation Complete
- **Completion Date**: 2025-09-21 17:01:18
- **Status**: Successfully implemented and tested

The new swap powerup functionality has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1. **Automatic Activation**: The swap mode activates automatically when the snake eats a swap orb
2. **Invulnerability**: During swap mode, the snake is invulnerable to collisions with walls, obstacles, and its own body
3. **Route Establishment**: The snake can move through obstacles during swap mode to establish a new route
4. **Pop Out Mechanism**: At the end of swap mode, the snake head pops out from the Tron trail at the current position
5. **Direction Calculation**: The new direction is calculated as opposite to the direction of the last two segments of the Tron trail
6. **Visual Indicators**: A clear visual indicator shows when swap mode is active with a countdown timer

## How to Use the New Swap Powerup
1. Collect a swap orb when it appears in the game
2. The snake will automatically enter swap mode for 5 seconds
3. During this time, the snake is invulnerable and can move through walls and its own body
4. Move the snake to establish the desired new route
5. When swap mode ends, the snake head will pop out from the trail with a new direction

## Verification
- âœ… Code passes all linting checks (with only minor console warnings)
- âœ… Swap mode activates automatically when orb is collected
- âœ… Visual indicator shows when swap mode is active
- âœ… Snake is invulnerable during swap mode
- âœ… Snake can pass through walls, obstacles, and its own body during swap mode
- âœ… At the end of swap mode, snake head pops out from the Tron trail
- âœ… New direction is opposite to the direction of the last two segments of the Tron trail
