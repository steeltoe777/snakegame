# 📚 Documentation Update Specification: Remove Line Count References

## 🎯 Purpose

Remove all line count references from README.md to eliminate the need for maintaining accurate line counts in documentation:
- Line counts in documentation are fragile and become outdated as code evolves
- Removing them reduces maintenance burden and prevents inconsistencies
- The target audience is developers and users who rely on the documentation
- The expected outcome is cleaner documentation that doesn't require constant updates for line count changes

## 📋 Content Changes

Remove line count references from README.md and rephrase descriptions:
- Remove "2003 lines of core game logic" and rephrase to "core game logic"
- Remove "80 lines of styling" and rephrase to "styling"
- Remove "750 lines of comprehensive tests" and rephrase to "comprehensive tests"
