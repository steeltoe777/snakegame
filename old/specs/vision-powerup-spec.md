# Vision Power-Up Specification

## üéØ Purpose

Implement a 'Vision' power-up that temporarily reveals the locations of all pellets and power-ups on the map, allowing players to strategically plan their routes through complex mazes.

## üìã Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation

**Purpose**: Validate idea with full context awareness and user-centric focus
**Content**:

- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs and pain points
      Players struggle to locate pellets and power-ups efficiently in complex maze layouts, leading to longer completion times and increased frustration in higher levels with dense maze structures and multiple power-ups.

- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition
      Temporary vision enhancement that reveals all collectibles on the map for strategic planning, without directly moving the snake or collecting items automatically.

- [x] Competitive analysis or alternative solutions
      Existing power-ups provide tactical advantages (speed, protection, attraction) but none offer strategic overview. This fills a gap in strategic gameplay elements.

- [x] Critical risks with mitigation strategies
      Risk: Overpowered if too frequent or long-lasting. Mitigation: Low spawn rate and moderate duration.
      Risk: Visual clutter with too much information. Mitigation: Clean, distinct visual indicators that don't obstruct gameplay.

- [x] Assumptions with validation criteria
      Assumption: Players will find vision useful in difficult situations. Validation: Test with various maze complexities.
      Assumption: Vision won't unbalance game progression. Validation: Monitor level completion rates.

**Gate**: [x] Ready for feasibility

### 2. [x] Feasibility & Priority

**Purpose**: Assess technical viability and strategic alignment
**Content**:

- [x] Technical feasibility with proof-of-concept approach
      Extend existing power-up system to support vision functionality. Utilize existing rendering system to draw indicators over existing game elements.

- [x] Resource estimates with time and complexity assessment

      Testing: 1-2 hours
      Total: 3-5 hours

- [x] Dependencies with impact analysis
      Depends on existing power-up system architecture. Requires minimal changes to game state and rendering logic.

- [x] Strategic alignment with product vision
      Aligns with core innovation principle of strategic depth. Complements existing tactical power-ups with strategic overview.

- [x] Priority justification with ROI analysis
      High impact on player experience with relatively low implementation cost. Addresses common player frustration point.
