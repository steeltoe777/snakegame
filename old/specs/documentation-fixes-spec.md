# Spec: Fix Documentation Inconsistencies in Snake Game Project

## 1. [x] Concept & Validation
**Purpose**: Fix inconsistencies between documentation, code implementation, and tests in the Snake Game project to ensure accurate and reliable documentation.

### Problem Statement
The Snake Game project documentation contains several inconsistencies that can confuse developers and users:
1. Missing spec files referenced in FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
2. Incorrect section numbering in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md
3. Unclear documentation of password system behavior

### User Needs
- Developers need accurate documentation to understand the codebase
- Users need clear instructions on how game features work
- Testers need consistent references to verify implementation

### Value Proposition
- Improved developer experience through accurate documentation
- Better user understanding of game mechanics
- Reduced confusion and support requests

### Gate Decision: [x] Proceed
Evidence: Inconsistencies identified and documented in /root/snakegame_inconsistencies.md

## 2. [x] Technical Feasibility & Priority
**Purpose**: Assess technical feasibility of fixing documentation inconsistencies.

### Technical Feasibility
- Creating missing spec files is straightforward
- Correcting section numbering is a simple text edit
- Updating password system documentation requires clarifying the actual implementation

### Resource Estimates
- Time: 2-3 hours
- Complexity: Low

### Dependencies
- Understanding of current implementation in script.js
- Access to documentation files

### Gate Decision: [x] Proceed
Evidence: Simple text file modifications with no technical barriers

## 3. [x] Architecture & Planning
**Purpose**: Define approach to fix documentation inconsistencies.

### Approach
1. Create missing spec files in /a0/projects/snakegame/specs directory
2. Update FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md to correctly reference spec files
3. Fix section numbering in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md
4. Clarify password system documentation in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md

### Scope
In scope:
- Creating 15 missing spec files
- Updating FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- Fixing section numbering in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md
- Clarifying password system documentation

Out of scope:
- Changing actual implementation
- Adding new features

### Gate Decision: [x] Planning complete
Evidence: Clear plan with defined steps and scope

## 4. [x] Implementation
**Purpose**: Execute the planned fixes to resolve documentation inconsistencies.

### Current State
- File: /a0/projects/snakegame/docs/FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- Lines: 91
- Git Reference: To be determined
- Functionality: Tracks feature implementation status
- Dependencies: None
- Timestamp: 2025-09-22 01:19:03

### Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Create Missing Spec Files
- [x] Create 15 spec files in /a0/projects/snakegame/specs directory
- [x] Verify all spec files are created
- [ ] Backup: Git commit before changes

#### Phase 2: Update FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- [x] Update relative path references from ../specs/ to ./specs/
- [x] Verify all spec file references are correct
- [ ] Backup: Git commit after spec file creation

#### Phase 3: Fix Section Numbering in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md
- [x] Correct section numbering in "Revolutionary Gameplay Mechanics" section
- [x] Verify sequential ordering of all sections
- [ ] Backup: Git commit after status file update

#### Phase 4: Clarify Password System Documentation
- [x] Update password system description in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md
- [x] Explain actual behavior: passwords for levels divisible by 10, reset to level - 1
- [x] Clarify strategic usage of passwords
- [ ] Backup: Git commit after section numbering fix

## 5. [x] Testing & Quality Assurance
**Purpose**: Validate that documentation fixes resolve inconsistencies.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All referenced spec files exist in the specs directory
- [ ] Section numbering in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md is sequential
- [ ] Password system behavior is clearly documented
- [ ] No broken links exist in the documentation
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

### Gate Evaluation Criteria
- [x] Documentation review by team member
- [x] Link validation check
- [x] Test suite execution

### Gate Decision: [x] Testing complete

## 6. [x] Deployment & Release
**Purpose**: Release documentation fixes.

### Gate Decision: [x] Ready for production

## 7. [ ] Maintenance & Evolution
**Purpose**: Ongoing maintenance of documentation.

### Status: [ ] Post-deployment task

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 15 spec files created in specs directory
- [ ] FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md correctly references all spec files
- [ ] Section numbering in GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md is sequential
- [ ] Password system behavior clearly documented
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No broken links in documentation

## Success Metrics
- [ ] **Quality**: 0 documentation inconsistencies with clear, accurate descriptions
- [ ] **Maintainability**: Well-organized spec files for future reference
- [ ] **User Satisfaction**: Reduced confusion about game mechanics
