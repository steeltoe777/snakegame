## üéØ Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality

- Spawn a compass power-up (blue compass icon) periodically in the game
- When collected, activate a visual compass that points to the nearest pellet
- The compass updates in real-time as the snake moves
- The compass effect lasts for a limited duration (e.g., 10 seconds)
- The compass deactivates when the duration expires or when the level ends

### Technical Specifications

#### System Components

- Power-up spawner: Adds compass to the list of possible power-ups
- Compass controller: Manages activation, duration, and deactivation
- Pathfinding service: Calculates direction to nearest pellet
- Compass renderer: Draws the visual compass on the canvas

#### Code Properties

```javascript
// Game state additions
compassActive: boolean,     // Whether compass is currently active
compassDuration: number,    // Remaining duration of compass effect
compassDirection: {x: number, y: number}, // Unit vector to nearest pellet
```

#### Implementation Logic

// 1. Add compass to power-up spawn probabilities
// 2. When compass collected, activate and start timer
// 3. Calculate direction to nearest pellet using BFS
// 4. Update direction each frame while active
// 5. Render visual compass overlay
// 6. Deactivate when timer expires

#### Integration Points

- Power-up system in script.js
- Game state management
- Canvas rendering system
- Game loop timing
