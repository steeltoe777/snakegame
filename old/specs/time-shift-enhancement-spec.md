## üìã Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation
**Purpose**: Validate idea with user-centric focus and honest feasibility assessment

**üìã Essential Content**:
- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition
- [x] Business/User Feasibility Gate

**Problem Statement**:
The time shift feature works correctly but lacks engaging feedback, making it less satisfying for users to use.

**Core Concept**:
Add sound effects and visual feedback to make the time shift feature more engaging and satisfying to use.

**Value Proposition**:
- Improved user experience through auditory and visual feedback
- More satisfying gameplay interactions
- Enhanced perception of feature quality

**‚úÖ Gate Evaluation**:
- [x] User demand validated with evidence (feature was requested)
- [x] Business value quantified (improved user satisfaction)
- [x] Stakeholder alignment achieved (feature aligns with game enhancement goals)

**Decision**: [x] Proceed

### 2. [x] Technical Feasibility & Priority
**Purpose**: Assess technical viability and resource requirements

**üìã Essential Content**:
- [x] Technical feasibility assessment
- [x] Resource estimates
- [x] Technical Constraints Gate

**Technical Feasibility**:
- Sound effects can be implemented using Web Audio API
- Visual effects can be implemented using DOM manipulation and CSS transitions
- Both approaches are compatible with the existing codebase

**Resource Estimates**:
- Development time: 2 hours
- Testing time: 1 hour
- Code review time: 30 minutes

**Technical Constraints**:
- Must maintain compatibility with existing browser support
- Should not significantly impact game performance
- Must not interfere with existing game functionality

**‚úÖ Gate Evaluation**:
- [x] Proof-of-concept validated (Web Audio API and DOM manipulation are proven technologies)
- [x] Resource requirements aligned (reasonable development effort)
- [x] Critical dependencies identified (None beyond standard web APIs)

**Decision**: [x] Proceed

### 3. [x] Architecture & Planning
**Purpose**: Define technical approach with implementation details

**üìã Essential Content**:
- [x] Architectural approach
- [x] Scope boundaries
- [x] Design Integrity Gate

**Architectural Approach**:
1. Add helper functions for sound generation using Web Audio API
2. Add helper function for screen flashing effects using DOM manipulation
3. Enhance existing time shift functions to call these helper functions
4. Maintain separation of concerns by keeping helper functions modular

**Scope Boundaries**:
- Only modify the time shift feature functions and add new helper functions
- Do not modify any other game functionality
- Do not change the core time shift logic

**‚úÖ Gate Evaluation**:
- [x] Architecture reviewed and approved (modular approach maintains code quality)
- [x] Critical requirements addressed (sound and visual feedback)
- [x] Integration points validated (helper functions integrate cleanly)

**Decision**: [x] Planning complete
