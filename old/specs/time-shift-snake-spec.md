## 🎯 Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
Add a time-shifting mechanic to the classic snake game where players can:
1. Mark a position in time with a special key
2. Temporarily shift the snake to that marked position
3. Return to the current timeline
4. Have a cooldown period between shifts

### Technical Specifications

#### System Components
- Game board rendering engine
- Snake movement logic
- Input handling system
- Timer/cooldown system
- Visual effects for time shift

#### Implementation Logic
// Time Shift Mechanic Logic Flow
// 1. Player presses time mark key (e.g., 'M')
// 2. Current snake head position saved with timestamp
// 3. Visual indicator shows marked position
// 4. Player presses shift key (e.g., 'T')
// 5. Snake instantly moves to marked position
// 6. Cooldown timer begins
// 7. After cooldown, player can shift back or mark new position

#### Integration Points
- Keyboard input handler
- Snake position tracking system
- Game state manager
- Rendering engine for visual effects
