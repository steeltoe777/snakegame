    - Players often get lost or trapped in corners without realizing it
    - No visual aid exists to help players understand their position relative to the entire board
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition and measurable outcomes
    - Add a small minimap in the corner of the screen showing the entire game board
    - Highlight the snake's position and important items (pellets, powerups)
    - Improve player navigation and strategic decision-making
- [x] Competitive analysis with market validation and differentiation
    - Many classic games (Zelda, GTA, etc.) include minimaps as a standard feature
    - Other snake games typically don't include minimaps, giving this game a unique advantage
