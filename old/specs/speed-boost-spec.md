# Speed Boost Power-up Specification

## ðŸŽ¯ Concept & Validation

### Problem Statement
Current game has mushroom power-ups for invincibility, but lacks variety in power-up types. Players need additional strategic options to enhance gameplay experience.

### Core Concept
Implement 'Speed Boost' power-ups that appear as lightning bolts, providing temporary increased movement speed for strategic advantage.

### Value Proposition
- Adds variety to power-up system
- Provides strategic gameplay choices (speed vs invincibility)
- Enhances replay value
- Complements existing mushroom power-ups

### Critical Risks
- Speed changes may affect collision detection accuracy
- Balance issues with game difficulty
- Potential performance impact with additional game state tracking

### Assumptions
- Players will enjoy speed-based power-ups as alternative to invincibility
- Technical implementation is feasible within current game architecture
- Performance impact will be minimal

**Gate**: [x] Ready for feasibility

## ðŸŽ¯ Feasibility & Priority

### Technical Feasibility
- Game already has power-up system framework (mushrooms)
- Speed adjustment mechanism exists (calculateGameSpeed function)
- Drawing system can accommodate new power-up type

### Resource Estimates
- 2-3 hours implementation time
- Minimal additional memory usage
- No external dependencies

### Dependencies
- script.js (main game logic)
- style.css (optional visual enhancements)
- Existing power-up infrastructure

### Strategic Alignment
- Enhances core gameplay without changing fundamental mechanics
- Builds on existing systems
- Increases game variety and engagement

### Priority Justification
High priority - simple addition with significant gameplay impact

**Gate**: [x] Proceed

## ðŸŽ¯ Architecture & Planning

### Architectural Approach
Extend existing power-up system to support multiple types:
1. Add lightningBolt power-up array to gameState
2. Create generation/spawning logic similar to mushrooms
3. Implement speed boost effect with timer
4. Add visual indicators

### System Components
- gameState.lightningBolts: []
- gameState.speedBoostActive: boolean
- gameState.speedBoostTimer: number
- gameState.speedBoostLastUpdate: number

### Scope Boundaries
**In Scope**:
- Speed boost power-up spawning
- Speed boost effect implementation
- Visual indicators
- Timer system

**Out of Scope**:
- New game modes
- Major architectural changes
- Additional power-up types beyond speed boost

### Requirements
1. Lightning bolts spawn on level 3+ with 2% probability
2. Speed boost lasts 6 seconds
3. Movement speed increases by 50% during boost
4. Visual timer indicator
5. Distinct visual appearance (yellow lightning bolt)

### Implementation Plan
1. Add gameState properties for speed boost
2. Implement lightning bolt generation
3. Add collision detection for lightning bolts
4. Implement speed boost effect
5. Add visual indicators
6. Testing and balancing

**Gate**: [x] Planning complete
