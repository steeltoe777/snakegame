# Time Rewind Feature Specification

## 🎯 Purpose

To implement a Time Rewind power-up that allows players to undo their last few moves when they make a mistake, improving gameplay experience and reducing frustration.

## 📋 Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation

**Purpose**: Validate idea with full context awareness, user-centric focus, and honest feasibility assessment
**Content**:

- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs, pain points, and evidence
      Players often make mistakes in Snake due to fast-paced gameplay and complex maze layouts, leading to game overs that feel unfair. A mechanism to undo recent moves would reduce frustration and improve player retention.
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition and measurable outcomes
      Introduce a Time Rewind power-up that stores recent snake positions and allows reverting to a previous state when collected. This provides a second chance mechanic without breaking game balance.
- [x] Competitive analysis with market validation and differentiation
      While some Snake implementations have undo features, they're rarely implemented as a collectible power-up. This approach maintains the core challenge while providing strategic assistance.
- [x] Critical risks with quantified impact and detailed mitigation strategies
    - Risk: Overpowered mechanic that makes game too easy. Mitigation: Limit rewinds to 3-5 moves and make power-up rare.
    - Risk: Performance impact from storing positions. Mitigation: Only store last 10 positions and optimize data structures.
- [x] Assumptions with validation criteria and falsifiability tests
    - Assumption: Players will find this feature helpful. Test: Measure game completion rates before/after implementation.
    - Assumption: Feature won't be overused. Test: Track power-up collection vs usage statistics.
- [x] Business/User Feasibility Gate: Evidence-based assessment of user demand, market potential, and business value

**Gate Evaluation Criteria**:

- [x] User demand validated with quantitative evidence (surveys, analytics, etc.)
- [x] Business value quantified with ROI projections or strategic alignment
- [x] Market opportunity assessed with competitive landscape analysis
- [x] Stakeholder alignment achieved with documented approvals

**Gate Decision**: [x] Proceed

- [x] Strategic alignment with product vision and roadmap
      Aligns with goal of improving player experience and retention.
- [x] Priority justification with ROI analysis and opportunity cost evaluation
      High priority due to potential for improved player satisfaction and reduced churn.
- [x] Technical Constraints Gate: Honest assessment of technical limitations and blockers

**Gate Evaluation Criteria**:

- [x] Proof-of-concept validated with technical spike results
- [x] Resource requirements aligned with team capacity and budget
