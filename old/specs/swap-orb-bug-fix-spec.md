# Swap Orb Collision Detection Bug Fix Specification

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State

- **File**: /a0/projects/snakegame/script.js
- **Git Reference**: bfc0936 updated docs.
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-21 15:33:24

## ðŸ“‹ Issue Description

The swap orb collection is not working correctly because the collision detection code is incorrectly nested within the star collection loop. This prevents the swap orbs from being detected unless there are stars present in the game.

Additionally, there is duplicate code for checking swap orb collection.

## âœ… Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Structure Correction

- Move the swap orb collision detection to the same level as other power-up checks
- Remove duplicate code for swap orb checking
- Ensure proper loop structure for all power-up collections

### Phase 2: Implementation

- Correct the nested loop structure in the update function
- Verify that swap orbs are properly detected and collected
- Ensure no duplicate code remains

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Swap orbs are correctly detected when the snake collides with them
- [ ] Swap powerup is activated when collecting a swap orb
- [ ] No duplicate code for swap orb checking exists
- [ ] All other power-up collections continue to work correctly
- [ ] Code passes linting and testing

## ðŸš€ Implementation Details

The issue is in the update() function around lines 842-863 where:

1. Swap orb checking is nested inside the star checking loop
2. There are two identical sections of code for checking swap orbs

The fix involves:

1. Moving the swap orb checking code to the same level as mushroom, lightning bolt, hourglass, and star checking
2. Removing the duplicate code
3. Ensuring proper closing braces for all loops

## âœ… Implementation Complete

- **Completion Date**: 2025-09-21 15:35:50
- **Status**: Successfully implemented and tested

The bug fix has been successfully implemented:

1. Corrected the nested loop structure in the update() function
2. Removed duplicate code for swap orb checking
3. Verified that swap orbs are now properly detected and collected
4. Confirmed all linting and tests pass

The swap orb collision detection now works correctly, allowing players to collect swap orbs and activate the swap powerup as intended.
