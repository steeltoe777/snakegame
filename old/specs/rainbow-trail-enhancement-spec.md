    - Making it conditional enhances the feeling of earning special effects
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition and measurable outcomes
    - Rainbow trail only active during mushroom power-up
    - Reverts to original blue trail when power-up is not active
    - Creates a more rewarding experience when collecting mushrooms
