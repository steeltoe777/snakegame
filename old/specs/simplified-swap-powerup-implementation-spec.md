# Simplified Swap Powerup Implementation Specification

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State

- **File**: /a0/projects/snakegame/script.js
- **Git Reference**: bfc0936 updated docs.
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-21 16:23:29

## ðŸ“‹ Issue Description

The current swap powerup implementation is overly complex:

1. Players must press Spacebar to enter segment selection mode
2. Players must then press numeric keys 1-9 to select specific segments
3. The numeric keys aren't working properly

This is confusing and unnecessarily complex for players.

## âœ… Simplified Implementation Plan

Simplify the swap powerup to directly swap the head and tail segments when the spacebar is pressed:

1. Remove the complex segment selection mode
2. Remove the numeric key bindings
3. Modify the spacebar handling to directly swap head and tail
4. Simplify the visual indicators

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Swap powerup activates for a defined duration when orb is collected
- [ ] Visual indicator shows when swap powerup is active
- [ ] Pressing Spacebar swaps the snake's head and tail segments
- [ ] Swap ability has a cooldown period
- [ ] Code passes linting and testing

## ðŸš€ Implementation Details

### Simplified Logic

1. When swap orb is collected:
    - Activate swap powerup for 10 seconds
    - Show visual indicator
2. When Spacebar is pressed and swap powerup is active:
    - Swap head (index 0) with tail (index gameState.snake.length - 1)
    - Activate 5-second cooldown
3. Update visual indicator during cooldown

### Changes Required

1. Modify handleDirectionChange() to remove numeric key bindings and simplify spacebar handling
2. Remove segment selection mode logic
3. Simplify visual indicators
4. Implement direct head-tail swap function

## âœ… Implementation Complete

- **Completion Date**: 2025-09-21 16:27:21
- **Status**: Successfully implemented and tested

The simplified swap powerup functionality has been successfully implemented with the following features:

1. **Direct Head-Tail Swap**: When the spacebar is pressed, the snake's head and tail segments are immediately swapped
2. **Timer Logic**: Added swapPowerupTimer and swapPowerupLastUpdate variables to track the powerup duration (10 seconds)
3. **Visual Indicators**:
    - "SWAP READY" indicator with timer bar when powerup is active and not on cooldown
    - "SWAP COOLDOWN" indicator with countdown bar when ability is on cooldown
4. **Cooldown Logic**: Added a 5-second cooldown period after using the swap ability
5. **Clean Implementation**: Removed all complex segment selection mode code, simplifying the overall implementation

## How to Use the Simplified Swap Powerup

1. Collect a swap orb when it appears in the game
2. When the "SWAP READY" indicator appears, press **Spacebar** to swap the snake's head and tail segments
3. The swap ability will have a **5-second cooldown** before it can be used again
4. During cooldown, the indicator will show "SWAP COOLDOWN" with a countdown bar

## Verification

- âœ… Code passes all linting checks (with only minor console warning)
- âœ… Swap powerup activates for 10 seconds when orb is collected
- âœ… Visual indicators show both active state and cooldown
- âœ… Pressing Spacebar swaps the snake's head and tail segments
- âœ… Swap ability has a 5-second cooldown period
- âœ… All unused variables and functions have been removed
