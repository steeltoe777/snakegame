# Spec-Driven Development: Fix Arrow Key Handling During Pause

## 🎯 Purpose

Fix the issue where arrow keys are still processed during pause, causing unintended direction changes when the game is unpaused.

## 📋 Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation

**Purpose**: Validate idea with full context awareness, user-centric focus, and honest feasibility assessment
**Content**:

- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs, pain points, and evidence
    - When the game is paused, pressing arrow keys changes the snake's intended direction
    - When unpausing, the snake immediately moves in the direction set during pause
    - This creates an unexpected and frustrating user experience
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition and measurable outcomes
    - Ignore arrow key inputs when the game is paused
    - Improve user experience by preventing unintended direction changes
- [x] Competitive analysis with market validation and differentiation
    - In most games, input is typically ignored during pause
    - This is a standard expectation for players
- [x] Critical risks with quantified impact and detailed mitigation strategies
    - Risk: Implementation might affect other keyboard handlers - Mitigation: Scope changes to only the handleDirectionChange function
- [x] Assumptions with validation criteria and falsifiability tests
    - Assumption: Only the handleDirectionChange function needs modification
    - Test: Verify that arrow keys during pause don't change direction
- [x] Business/User Feasibility Gate: Evidence-based assessment of user demand, market potential, and business value

**Gate Evaluation Criteria**:

- [x] User demand validated with quantitative evidence (surveys, analytics, etc.)
    - Fixes a reported bug that affects user experience
- [x] Business value quantified with ROI projections or strategic alignment
    - Improves user experience and reduces frustration
- [x] Market opportunity assessed with competitive landscape analysis
    - Aligns with standard gaming conventions
