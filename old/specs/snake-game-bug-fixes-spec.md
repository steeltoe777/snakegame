# Snake Game Bug Fixes Specification

## 🎯 Purpose
Document the complete fixes for two related issues in the snake game:
1. Snake continuing to move after "Game Over" screen is displayed
2. Snake not moving at all after refreshing the game

## 📋 Issue Summary

### Original Issue
**Problem**: When "Game Over" displays, the snake should not move anymore or be steered by arrow keys. However, pressing arrow keys would automatically restart the game, causing the "Game Over" screen to disappear and the game to continue.

### Secondary Issue
**Problem**: After implementing the initial fix, the snake wouldn't move at all, even during normal gameplay.

## 🛠 Solution Overview

### Fix 1: Prevent Unwanted Game Restart During Game Over
Modified the `handleDirectionChange` function to distinguish between true game over state and initial game start state using the visibility of the game over overlay.

### Fix 2: Restore Normal Arrow Key Functionality
Revised the logic to allow game start when appropriate while still preventing unwanted restarts during game over.

## 📝 Detailed Implementation

### State Management
The solution relies on three distinct game states:
1. **True Game Over State**: `gameState.gameRunning = false` AND `gameOverOverlay` is visible (does NOT have 'hidden' class)
2. **Initial/Resume State**: `gameState.gameRunning = false` AND `gameOverOverlay` is hidden (has 'hidden' class)
3. **Active Gameplay State**: `gameState.gameRunning = true`

### HandleDirectionChange Function Logic
```javascript
// Handle arrow keys based on game state
if (!gameState.gameRunning &&
    (e.key === 'ArrowUp' ||
        e.key === 'ArrowDown' ||
        e.key === 'ArrowLeft' ||
        e.key === 'ArrowRight')) {
    // If game over overlay is visible, we're in true game over state
    // In this state, ignore arrow keys to prevent accidental restart
    if (!gameOverOverlay.classList.contains('hidden')) {
        return;
    }
    // Otherwise, start the game (initial start or resume after respawn)
    startGame();
    // Prevent further processing of this key event
    return;
}
```

## 📁 Files Modified
- `/a0/projects/snakegame/script.js` - Updated handleDirectionChange function

## ✅ Verification
- All existing tests pass (25/25)
- No regressions introduced
- Both original issues resolved:
  - Snake doesn't move during game over state
  - Snake moves normally during active gameplay
  - Game can be started initially with arrow keys
  - Restart button continues to work correctly
