# Mirror Orb Implementation Fix - Spec

## üéØ Purpose
Fix the incomplete mirror orb implementation to ensure mirror orbs are properly generated and spawned in the game.

## üìã Current Issues
1. The generateMirrorOrbs function uses incorrect probability (0.005 instead of 0.1)
2. The spawnRandomMirrorOrb function is missing entirely

## üéØ Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Fix generateMirrorOrbs to use 0.1 probability
- Implement spawnRandomMirrorOrb function that can spawn mirror orbs during gameplay
- Ensure proper collision detection with all game elements
- Add spawned orbs to gameState.mirrorOrbs array

### Technical Specifications

#### System Components
- gameState.mirrorOrbs array
- generateMirrorOrbs function
- spawnRandomMirrorOrb function (to be implemented)

#### Implementation Logic
1. Update generateMirrorOrbs probability from 0.005 to 0.1
2. Implement spawnRandomMirrorOrb with:
   - Level requirement (level >= 3)
   - Probability of 0.1
   - Collision detection with all game elements
   - Addition to gameState.mirrorOrbs array

#### Integration Points
- Game update loop (where spawn functions are called)
- gameState object

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

### üéØ Current State
- **File**: /a0/projects/snakegame/script.js
- **Lines**: 2112
- **Git Reference**: [commit hash]
- **Functionality**: Incomplete mirror orb generation
- **Dependencies**: gameState object, maze logic
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-21 00:50:49

### ‚úÖ Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Fix generateMirrorOrbs Function
- [ ] Update probability from 0.005 to 0.1 in generateMirrorOrbs function
- [ ] Verify collision detection includes all game elements
- [ ] Test that orbs are added to gameState.mirrorOrbs

#### Phase 2: Implement spawnRandomMirrorOrb Function
- [ ] Create spawnRandomMirrorOrb function following existing patterns
- [ ] Set level requirement to 3+
- [ ] Set probability to 0.1
- [ ] Implement collision detection with all game elements
- [ ] Add spawned orbs to gameState.mirrorOrbs

#### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Verify both functions work correctly
- [ ] Test in game context
- [ ] Confirm mirror orbs appear with appropriate frequency

## ‚úÖ Detailed Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] generateMirrorOrbs uses 0.1 probability
- [ ] spawnRandomMirrorOrb function exists and works correctly
- [ ] Both functions properly check for collisions with all game elements
- [ ] Mirror orbs are added to gameState.mirrorOrbs array
- [ ] Mirror orbs appear in the game with appropriate frequency

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Considerations

### Probability & Duration
| Power-Up/Feature | Probability | Duration | Effect |
|------------------|------------|----------|--------|
| Mirror Orbs | 0.1 | Permanent | Mirror movement controls |

### Strategic Value
| Aspect | Value | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Game Balance | Medium | Adds interesting gameplay mechanic |
| Complexity | Low | Follows existing patterns |

## üîß Best Practices
- Follow existing spawn function patterns
- Maintain consistent collision detection logic
- Use same level requirements as similar features
- Ensure proper commenting

## üìä Success Metrics
- [ ] **Functionality**: Mirror orbs appear in game with 0.1 probability
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Implementation follows existing patterns
- [ ] **Game Balance**: No negative impact on gameplay
