# 📚 Documentation Update Specification: Fix Line Count Inconsistencies

## 🎯 Purpose

Update the README.md file to correct inaccurate line count information for script.js and script.test.js files:

- The README currently states script.js has 1861 lines, but it actually has 2003 lines
- The README currently states script.test.js has 501 lines, but it actually has 750 lines
- These inconsistencies should be corrected to ensure documentation accuracy
- The target audience is developers and users who rely on the documentation for accurate information
- The expected outcome is that the documentation accurately reflects the actual line counts of the code files

## 📋 Content Changes

Update the specific line count references in README.md:

- Change "1861 lines of core game logic" to "2003 lines of core game logic" in the file structure diagram
- Change "501 lines of comprehensive tests" to "750 lines of comprehensive tests" in the file structure diagram
- Change "501 lines of unit tests" to "750 lines of unit tests" in the development features section
- Change "501 lines of comprehensive test coverage" to "750 lines of comprehensive test coverage" in the unique selling points section
