## TASK-006

---

STATUS: OPEN

Improve code quality and documentation with the following contract:

- Input: Current script.js codebase
- Output: Refactored, documented, and tested code
- Preconditions:
    - All existing functionality must be preserved
    - Backward compatibility maintained
- Postconditions:
    - Code is properly organized into modules/classes
    - Comprehensive JSDoc comments for all functions
    - README features are fully implemented and verified
    - Performance benchmarks show no regression
    - Test coverage maintained or improved
- Invariants:
    - External API remains unchanged
    - Game behavior identical to original
    - All existing tests pass
- Error handling:
    - Refactoring errors: revert changes and report issues
    - Performance regressions: optimize before deployment
- Performance: No regression in frame rate or responsiveness
- Thread safety: Maintain current thread safety characteristics

Generate the implementation with comprehensive improvements.
Include before/after examples of key refactorings.
Add type hints and JSDoc comments throughout.

Specific improvements required:

1. Organize code into logical modules (GameCore, Renderer, InputHandler, etc.)
2. Add comprehensive JSDoc comments for all functions
3. Verify all README features are actually implemented:
    - Hybrid gameplay mechanics (Snake + Pac-Man + Tron)
    - Password system functionality
    - Level progression scaling
    - Wrap-around boundaries for levels 1000+
    - Respawn and regression system
4. Remove magic numbers and hardcoded values
5. Improve variable naming and code readability
6. Add performance profiling and optimization hints
7. Update documentation to reflect actual implementation

Test cases that MUST pass:

1. All existing Jest tests continue to pass
2. Manual gameplay testing confirms all hybrid mechanics work
3. Performance testing shows no frame rate drops
4. Code complexity metrics improve (lower cyclomatic complexity)
5. Documentation coverage: 100% of functions have JSDoc comments
6. README features verification: all claimed features are functional

Dependencies: ESLint, Prettier for code quality enforcement
