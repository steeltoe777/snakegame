# ADR 001: Module Structure for Game Logic

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The initial development of the Snake, Tron, Pac-Man Hybrid Game places all JavaScript logic within a single `script.js` file. As the game grows in complexity and features, maintaining a single large file will become challenging, leading to:

*   Difficulty in locating specific functionalities.
*   Increased risk of unintended side effects when modifying code.
*   Reduced reusability of components.
*   Slower development cycles due to larger file sizes and potential for merge conflicts.

## Decision

We will adopt a modular structure for the game's JavaScript logic. Initially, this will involve logically separating concerns within `script.js` using comments and clear function boundaries. For future iterations, we will refactor `script.js` into multiple, smaller JavaScript files, each responsible for a specific domain of the game (e.g., snake movement, maze generation, pellet management, game loop, UI updates).

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Improved Maintainability:** Smaller, focused files are easier to understand, debug, and modify.
*   **Enhanced Readability:** Clear separation of concerns makes the codebase more intuitive.
*   **Increased Reusability:** Individual modules can be more easily reused in other parts of the game or even in different projects.
*   **Better Collaboration:** Reduces merge conflicts when multiple developers work on different parts of the game.
*   **Easier Testing:** Unit testing can be more granular, focusing on individual module functionalities.

### Negative

*   **Initial Overhead:** Requires time and effort to refactor the existing monolithic `script.js`.
*   **Module Loading:** Introduces the need for proper module loading mechanisms (e.g., ES Modules with `type="module"` in `index.html` or a build step).
*   **Increased File Count:** More files to manage, though this is a minor concern compared to the benefits.

## Future Considerations

*   **ES Modules:** Transition to native ES Modules (`import`/`export`) for dependency management.
*   **Build Tools:** Potentially integrate a build tool (e.g., Webpack, Rollup) for bundling, minification, and transpilation if the project scales further.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Consider patterns for managing dependencies between modules.
