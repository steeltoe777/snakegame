# üìã Feature Implementation Status Summary

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-20 18:15:25
**Document Version**: 1.0

This document provides a clear overview of which features have been implemented in the codebase versus which specs exist but are not implemented.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

These features are currently implemented and functional in the game:

1. **Rainbow Trail**
   - Enhanced to be conditional (only active during mushroom power-up)
   - Spec file: `rainbow-trail-spec.md` and `rainbow-trail-enhancement-spec.md`
   - Implementation: Yes (recently added)

2. **Speed Boost (Lightning Bolts)**
   - Increases snake movement speed temporarily
   - Spec file: `speed-boost-spec.md`
   - Implementation: Yes (by Frank Schmidt)

3. **Time Slow (Hourglasses)**
   - Decreases snake movement speed temporarily for precision navigation
   - Spec file: `time-slow-spec.md` and `hourglass-implementation-spec.md`
   - Implementation: Yes (by Frank Schmidt)

4. **Score Multiplier (Golden Stars)**
   - Doubles points earned from pellet collection
   - Spec file: `score-multiplier-spec.md`
   - Implementation: Yes (by Frank Schmidt)

- **Minimap Navigation System** - Real-time minimap showing snake position and items ([spec](../specs/minimap-spec.md))

6. **Pause/Resume Functionality**
   - Allows players to pause and resume the game using the 'P' key
   - Displays a visual indicator when the game is paused
   - Spec file: `pause-resume-spec.md`
   - Implementation: Yes (2025-09-21)
## ‚ùå Non-Implemented Features

These features have specs but are NOT currently implemented in the codebase:

1. **Shield Power-Up**
   - Provides temporary invincibility against all collision types
   - Spec file: `shield-powerup-spec.md`
   - Implementation: No

2. **Magnetic Attraction**
   - Pulls pellets toward the snake within a certain radius
   - Spec file: `magnetic-attraction-spec.md`
   - Implementation: No

3. **Portal System**
   - Allows instant teleportation between two points on the game board
   - Spec file: `portal-system-spec.md`
   - Implementation: No

4. **Ghost Mode**
   - Allows snake to pass through walls temporarily
   - Spec file: `ghost-mode-spec.md`
   - Implementation: No

5. **Split Snake**
   - Temporarily splits snake into multiple segments
   - Spec file: `split-snake-spec.md`
   - Implementation: No

6. **Vision Power-Up**
   - Temporarily reveals the entire maze layout
   - Spec file: `vision-powerup-spec.md`
   - Implementation: No

7. **Vortex Mode**
   - Creates a swirling effect that pulls pellets toward the snake
   - Spec file: `vortex-mode-spec.md`
   - Implementation: No

## üìä Statistics

- **Total Specs**: 15
- **Implemented**: 5 (33%)
- **Not Implemented**: 7 (47%)
- **Partially Implemented/Abandoned**: 3 (20%)

## üìù Notes

1. Some specs (like speed boost and time slow) were created but implementation proceeded without updating the specs to "complete" status
2. The hourglass feature appears to be the same as the time slow feature
3. The rainbow trail enhancement was recently added and properly documented with a separate spec
4. All implemented features have corresponding drawing functions in the codebase
