# 📚 Documentation Update Specification

## 🎯 Purpose

Update the gameplay design documentation to accurately reflect the actual implementation of the maze generation and pellet distribution systems:

- The maze generation creates more walls than originally documented
- The pellet distribution uses a more complex scaling formula than documented
- These updates will ensure the documentation accurately describes the implemented systems
- Target audience is developers and contributors to the project
- Expected outcome is documentation that accurately reflects the implemented systems

## 📋 Content Changes

Detail the specific content that needs to be added, modified, or removed:

- Modify the "Level-Based Maze Scaling" table to reflect actual wall counts
- Update the "Pellet Distribution" section to better describe the scaling mechanism
- Ensure all references to these systems are consistent

## 📁 Files to Update

- [ ] docs/GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md (Update maze scaling table and pellet distribution description)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the implemented systems
- [ ] All links and references are working correctly
- [ ] Formatting is consistent with the rest of the documentation
- [ ] No broken images or missing media
- [ ] Technical accuracy verified
- [ ] Grammar and spelling checked

## 🔄 Update Approach

- Rewrite the maze scaling table to reflect actual implementation
- Enhance the pellet distribution description to acknowledge the complexity of the scaling formula
- Maintain the existing documentation style and format
- Review the code to ensure accuracy of the updated documentation

## 📋 Implementation Steps

1. [ ] Review the current GAMEPLAY_DESIGN.md document
2. [ ] Examine the actual implementation in the codebase
3. [ ] Update the maze scaling table with more accurate wall counts
4. [ ] Revise the pellet distribution description to better reflect the implementation
5. [ ] Verify technical accuracy by cross-referencing with code
6. [ ] Proofread for grammar and spelling
7. [ ] Review for consistency with rest of documentation

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- Documentation accurately describes the implemented systems
- Updated documentation is merged to the main branch
- No discrepancies reported between documentation and implementation

## 📚 Review Process

- Technical review by examining the actual implementation
- Proofreading for grammar and spelling
- Consistency check with rest of documentation
