### Core Functionality

- **Shield Power-Up**: Cyan (#00FFFF) diamond shape with rotating effect
- **Duration**: 6 seconds
- **Spawn Rate**: 1.2% probability on level 6+
- **Protection**: Immunity to wall, self, and trail collisions

### Technical Specifications

#### GameState Properties

```javascript
shields: [],              // Array of {x, y} positions
shieldActive: false,      // Activation state
shieldTimer: 0,           // Remaining time in milliseconds
shieldLastUpdate: 0,      // Timestamp reference
```

#### Shield Generation Logic

// Shield generation creates single power-up:
// 1. Generate shield at valid position (not overlapping other elements)
// 2. Add to gameState.shields array

#### Shield Activation Logic

// When shield is active:
// 1. Bypass all collision detection
// 2. Show visual effect
// 3. Decrement timer
// 4. Remove shield effect when timer expires

| ---------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| **Shield** | 1.2%        | 6 seconds | Collision immunity |
