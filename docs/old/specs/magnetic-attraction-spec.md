# Magnetic Attraction Power-Up Specification

## üéØ Concept & Validation

### Problem Statement

Players struggle to collect pellets in complex maze layouts, especially in corners and tight spaces. This leads to longer completion times and increased frustration in higher levels with dense maze structures.

### Core Concept

Implement a 'Magnet' power-up that creates a temporary magnetic field around the snake, attracting nearby pellets toward the snake's head for easier collection in challenging maze configurations.

### Value Proposition

- Solves pellet collection difficulty in complex maze layouts
- Reduces player frustration in higher difficulty levels
- Adds strategic timing element for power-up usage
- Complements existing power-up ecosystem without overlap
- Maintains core gameplay while enhancing accessibility

### Critical Risks

- May make level completion too easy, reducing challenge
- Could conflict with maze design intent in puzzle-like levels
- Might cause performance issues with many pellets on screen
- Visual indicators may not be clear enough for players
- Balancing attraction strength and duration could be challenging

### Assumptions

- Players will appreciate assistance with pellet collection
- Technical implementation is feasible within current architecture
- Performance impact will be minimal with proper optimization
- Visual design can clearly communicate the magnetic effect
- Attraction effect will be satisfying and intuitive to use

**Gate**: [x] Ready for feasibility

## üéØ Architecture & Planning

### Architectural Approach

Extend existing power-up system to support magnetic attraction functionality:

1. Add magnet power-up array to gameState
2. Create generation/spawning logic similar to other power-ups
3. Implement attraction effect with physics-like simulation
4. Add visual indicators and animation effects

### System Components

- gameState.magnets: [] (array of {x, y} positions)
- gameState.magnetActive: boolean (activation state)
- gameState.magnetTimer: number (remaining time)
- gameState.magnetLastUpdate: number (timestamp reference)
- gameState.magnetStrength: number (attraction force multiplier)

### Scope Boundaries

**In Scope**:

- Magnet power-up spawning and generation
- Pellet attraction effect implementation
- Visual indicators and animation effects
- Integration with existing collision detection

**Out of Scope**:

- New game modes or major architectural changes
- Attraction of other game elements (walls, mushrooms, etc.)
- Complex physics simulation beyond basic attraction

### Requirements

1. Magnets spawn on level 5+ with 1.5% probability
2. Magnet effect lasts 8 seconds
3. Attraction radius: 5 grid units
4. Visual indicator: Purple (#800080) pulsing effect
5. Animation: Pellets move smoothly toward snake head

### Implementation Plan

1. Add gameState properties for magnet system
2. Implement magnet generation and spawning
3. Add collision detection for magnets
4. Implement attraction effect logic
5. Add visual indicators and animation effects
6. Testing and balancing with existing power-ups

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Game State Additions

```javascript
// Add to gameState object:
magnets: [],              // Array of {x, y} positions
magnetActive: false,      // Activation state
magnetTimer: 0,           // Remaining time in milliseconds
magnetLastUpdate: 0,      // Timestamp reference
magnetStrength: 0.2       // Attraction force multiplier
```

### Magnet Generation Logic

```javascript
// Magnet generation creates single power-up:
// 1. Generate magnet at valid position (not overlapping other elements)
// 2. Add to gameState.magnets array
// 3. Handle collision and removal when collected
```

### Attraction Effect Implementation

```javascript
// When magnet is active:
// 1. Calculate distance between snake head and each pellet
// 2. For pellets within attraction radius:
//    a. Calculate direction vector toward snake head
//    b. Move pellet position gradually in that direction
//    c. Check for collision with snake after movement
// 3. Remove magnet effect when timer expires
```

### Collision Detection Integration

```javascript
// Add to checkCollisions() function:
checkMagnetCollision();
```

### Visual Drawing Integration

```javascript
// Add to drawGame() function:
drawMagnets();
// Add to drawSnake() or separate function:
drawMagnetEffect();
```
