## 🎯 Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality

When a player's snake collects the Teleport power-up:

1. The snake instantly moves to a random safe position on the game board
2. The power-up disappears from the board
3. No timer is needed as the effect is instant
4. The new position is validated to ensure it's not inside walls, other power-ups, or the snake itself

### Technical Specifications

#### System Components

- gameState object: Track teleport power-up state
- Canvas rendering system: Draw teleport power-up on game board
- Collision detection system: Validate safe teleport positions
- Game update loop: Handle power-up collection and effect activation

#### Code Properties

```javascript
// Teleport power-up properties in gameState
teleports: [],           // Array of active teleport power-up positions
lastTeleportSpawn: 0,    // Timestamp of last teleport spawn
```

#### Implementation Logic

1. Generate teleport power-ups similar to other power-ups
2. When snake head collides with teleport power-up:
   a. Find a random safe position on the board
   b. Move snake head to that position
   c. Remove teleport power-up from board
3. Ensure new position doesn't cause immediate collisions

#### Integration Points

- gameState object for state management
- Canvas API for rendering
- Existing collision detection functions
- Game update loop for effect processing

## 🐛 Bug Fix Details

### Issue Description

Fixed a bug where collecting a teleport power-up would sometimes not work correctly:

1. The teleport would appear to remain on the board after the snake ran over it
2. In some cases, collecting a teleport would do nothing

### Root Cause

The bug was caused by two issues in the teleport collection logic:

1. **Array Iteration Bug**: When removing a teleport from the gameState.teleports array using splice(), the loop continued incrementing the index, causing it to skip checking the next teleport in the array.
2. **Incorrect Variable Assignment**: Setting atePellet = true for teleport collection was incorrect since a teleport is not a pellet.
3. **Extra Break Statement**: An extraneous break statement was interfering with the power-up collection logic.

### Solution

1. Fixed the array iteration by iterating backwards through the teleports array when checking for collection
2. Changed atePellet = true to a more appropriate variable for teleport collection
3. Removed the extraneous break statement

### Code Changes

Updated the teleport collection logic in the update function to properly handle array removal and effect activation.
