**Status**: [ ] Maintenance ready

## üéØ Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality

1. When not in swap mode, snake should turn in random directions when hitting its own body instead of dying
2. When swap mode ends, snake head should correctly pop from trail with opposite direction of trail

### Technical Specifications

#### System Components

- script.js

#### Implementation Logic

1. Fix collision detection to allow snake to pass through its own body (turn in random directions)
2. Fix popSnakeFromTrail function to correctly calculate opposite direction and position snake head

#### Integration Points

- Game update loop
- Rendering system

## üöÄ Implementation Template

### üéØ Current State

- **File**: /a0/projects/snakegame/script.js
- **Lines**: ~1200
- **Git Reference**: Before changes
- **Lint+Tests**: Some failing tests (pre-existing)
- **Functionality**: Swap powerup not working correctly
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Timestamp**: 2025-09-21 19:10:00

### ‚úÖ Execution Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation

- [x] **Task 1.1**: Fix collision detection logic for snake body
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Verify collision detection with trail still works correctly
- [x] **Verify**: Test that snake turns in random directions when hitting its own body
- [ ] **Backup**: Git commit before changes

#### Phase 2: Core Implementation

- [x] **Task 2.1**: Fix popSnakeFromTrail function direction calculation
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Verify snake head correctly positioned at trail end
- [x] **Verify**: Test that snake pops from trail with correct opposite direction
- [ ] **Document**: Note changes in code comments

#### Phase 3: Enhancement

- [ ] **Task 3.1**: Improve visual feedback for swap mode
- [ ] **Task 3.2**: Optimize trail management
- [ ] **Verify**: Ensure smooth gameplay experience
- [ ] **Update**: Update any related documentation

#### Phase 4: Validation

- [ ] **Task 4.1**: Comprehensive testing of swap powerup
- [ ] **Task 4.2**: Verify no regression in other game features
- [ ] **Verify**: All tests pass (except pre-existing failures)
- [ ] **Archive**: Commit changes with descriptive message

## ‚úÖ Detailed Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Snake turns in random directions when hitting its own body (not in swap mode)
- [ ] Snake dies when hitting trail segments (not in swap mode)
- [ ] Snake head correctly pops from trail with opposite direction when swap mode ends
- [ ] Swap mode indicator displays correctly
- [ ] All existing game functionality remains intact

## ‚öñÔ∏è Balance Considerations

### Comparative Analysis

| Feature                   | Current       | Proposed              | Impact            | Feasibility Assessment |

## üîß Best Practices

### Pattern Consistency

- [ ] Follow existing code patterns in script.js
- [ ] Maintain consistent naming conventions

### Git Integration

- [ ] Reference latest hash before changes
- [ ] Use `git restore` for rollbacks

### Incremental Validation

- [ ] Test each fix separately
- [ ] Validate: collision detection ‚Üí trail popping
- [ ] Run tests after each phase

### System Integration

- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Document API changes

### Code Quality

- [ ] Follow JavaScript style guide
- [ ] Include inline documentation

## üìä Success Metrics

- [ ] **Reliability**: Swap powerup works consistently
- [ ] **Quality**: Linting passes with minimal warnings
- [ ] **User Satisfaction**: Issues reported by user are resolved
