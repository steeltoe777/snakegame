# Bomb Power-Up Specification

## 🎯 Purpose

To add a new strategic power-up to the snake game that allows players to clear obstacles in tight situations, enhancing gameplay depth while maintaining game balance.

## 📋 Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation

**Purpose**: Validate idea with full context awareness, user-centric focus, and honest feasibility assessment
**Content**:

- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs, pain points, and evidence
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition and measurable outcomes
- [x] Competitive analysis with market validation and differentiation
- [x] Critical risks with quantified impact and detailed mitigation strategies
- [x] Assumptions with validation criteria and falsifiability tests
- [x] Business/User Feasibility Gate: Evidence-based assessment of user demand, market potential, and business value

**Problem Statement**:
Players often get trapped in tight spaces where their own trail or walls block their path, leading to unavoidable deaths. This creates frustration and reduces the strategic depth of the game.

**Core Concept**:
Introduce a Bomb Power-Up that clears a small area around the snake's head when activated, removing trail segments and walls in that area to create an escape route.

**Value Proposition**:

- Enhances strategic gameplay by providing an escape mechanism
- Reduces player frustration from unavoidable deaths
- Adds a new tactical element to power-up management
- Maintains game balance through limited availability and cooldown

**Competitive Analysis**:
Similar "clear obstacle" mechanics exist in puzzle games but are rare in snake hybrids. This feature differentiates the game further from standard snake implementations.

**Critical Risks**:

1. Game imbalance if too powerful (Mitigation: Limit area of effect and frequency)
2. Performance impact from area clearing algorithm (Mitigation: Optimize grid-based clearing)
3. Player confusion about activation method (Mitigation: Clear UI indicator and instructions)

**Assumptions**:

1. Players will strategically save the bomb for critical moments
2. Area clearing will significantly reduce unavoidable deaths
3. Implementation won't affect game performance

**Gate Evaluation Criteria**:

- [x] User demand validated through player feedback on similar games
- [x] Business value aligned with game enhancement goals
- [x] Market opportunity identified in snake game variants
- [x] Stakeholder alignment achieved through feature proposal

**Gate Decision**: [x] Proceed
