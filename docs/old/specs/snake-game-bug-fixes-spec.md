# Snake Game Bug Fixes Specification (Updated)

## üéØ Purpose

Document the complete fixes for the snake game issues:

1. Snake continuing to move after "Game Over" screen is displayed
2. Snake not moving at all after refreshing the game
3. Game going to game over immediately when trying to move snake initially

## üìã Issue Summary

### Issue 1: Game Over Bug

**Problem**: When "Game Over" displays, the snake should not move anymore or be steered by arrow keys. However, pressing arrow keys would automatically restart the game, causing the "Game Over" screen to disappear and the game to continue.

### Issue 2: Movement Bug

**Problem**: After implementing the first fix, the snake wouldn't move at all, even during normal gameplay.

### Issue 3: Immediate Game Over Bug

**Problem**: After implementing the second fix, the game would go to game over immediately when trying to move the snake initially.

## üõ† Solution Overview

### Fix 1: Prevent Unwanted Game Restart During Game Over

Modified the `handleDirectionChange` function to distinguish between true game over state and initial game start state using the visibility of the game over overlay.

### Fix 2: Restore Normal Arrow Key Functionality

Revised the logic to allow game start when appropriate while still preventing unwanted restarts during game over.

### Fix 3: Ensure Proper Direction Setting on Game Start

Fixed a logic error where arrow key processing was being skipped after starting the game, which prevented dx/dy from being set correctly.

## üìù Detailed Implementation

### State Management

The solution relies on three distinct game states:

1. **True Game Over State**: `gameState.gameRunning = false` AND `gameOverOverlay` is visible (does NOT have 'hidden' class)
2. **Initial/Resume State**: `gameState.gameRunning = false` AND `gameOverOverlay` is hidden (has 'hidden' class)
3. **Active Gameplay State**: `gameState.gameRunning = true`

### HandleDirectionChange Function Logic

```javascript
// Handle arrow keys based on game state
if (
    !gameState.gameRunning &&
    (e.key === 'ArrowUp' ||
        e.key === 'ArrowDown' ||
        e.key === 'ArrowLeft' ||
        e.key === 'ArrowRight')
) {
    // If game over overlay is visible, we're in true game over state
    // In this state, ignore arrow keys to prevent accidental restart
    if (!gameOverOverlay.classList.contains('hidden')) {
        return;
    }
    // Otherwise, start the game (initial start or resume after respawn)
    startGame();
    // Continue to allow normal arrow key processing
}

switch (e.key) {
    case 'ArrowUp':
        if (gameState.dy !== 1) {
            gameState.dxPrev = gameState.dx;
            gameState.dyPrev = gameState.dy;
            gameState.dx = 0;
            gameState.dy = -1;
        }
        break;
    // ... other cases
}
```

The key insight for Fix 3 was to NOT return early after calling `startGame()`, which allows the switch statement to process the arrow key and set the correct direction.
