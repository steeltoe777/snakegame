## [x] 1. Concept & Validation

### Problem Statement

As game levels increase in complexity with denser mazes and more pellets to collect, players face challenges in efficiently navigating the snake to collect all pellets while avoiding collisions. The game lacks a power-up that fundamentally changes gameplay to help players overcome particularly challenging level layouts.

### Core Concept

Implement a "Split Snake" power-up that temporarily splits the snake into two separate, independently controllable snakes. Both snakes would be controlled with the same input keys but move in mirrored directions, allowing players to collect pellets from multiple areas simultaneously and navigate complex maze sections more efficiently.

### Competitive Analysis

Traditional snake games don't typically feature multi-snake control. This innovative mechanic draws inspiration from games like Slither.io but adapts it to the constrained grid-based environment of classic snake, offering a unique strategic element not found in other snake game variants.

### Critical Risks

- May be too powerful if duration is too long or spawn rate too frequent
- Could cause confusion with controls for new players
- Might introduce performance issues with dual snake collision detection
- Visual representation of two snakes could be unclear

### Mitigation Strategies

- Limit duration to 5-7 seconds with moderate spawn rate
- Provide clear visual distinction between primary and secondary snake
- Thoroughly test collision detection performance
- Use distinct colors and styling for each snake

### Assumptions

- Players will enjoy the challenge of controlling two snakes simultaneously
- The mechanic will provide genuine strategic value without breaking game balance
- Visual design can clearly differentiate the two snakes

**Gate**: [x] Ready for feasibility

## [x] 2. Feasibility & Priority

### Technical Feasibility

High - The game already has robust systems for snake movement, collision detection, and power-up management. Creating a second snake entity that mirrors the primary snake's controls but in opposite directions is achievable within the existing architecture.

### Resource Estimates

- Development: 6-8 hours
- Testing: 3-4 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour

### Dependencies

- Existing snake movement system
- Collision detection framework
- Power-up generation and management system
- Rendering system

### Strategic Alignment

This feature enhances core gameplay by introducing a novel mechanic that complements existing power-ups while providing a unique strategic option. It aligns with the game's innovative approach to the classic snake formula.

### Priority Justification

Medium-high priority - Adds significant gameplay innovation that differentiates the game from standard snake implementations while building on existing systems.

**Gate**: [x] Proceed

## [x] 3. Architecture & Planning

### Architectural Approach

Extend the existing power-up system to support the split snake functionality:

1. Add split snake power-up to item generation system
2. Implement dual snake state management
3. Create mirrored control system for secondary snake
4. Implement dual snake collision detection
5. Add visual distinction between snakes
6. Manage snake recombination after power-up expiration

### System Components

- gameState.splitSnakeActive: boolean (activation state)
- gameState.splitSnakeTimer: number (remaining time)
- gameState.splitSnakeLastUpdate: number (timestamp reference)
- gameState.secondarySnake: array (segments for second snake)
- gameState.secondaryDx/Dy: number (direction vectors for second snake)

### Scope Boundaries

**In Scope**:

- Split snake power-up generation and collection
- Dual snake movement and control system
- Dual snake collision detection
- Visual indicators for both snakes
- Proper merging of snakes after power-up expiration

**Out of Scope**:

- Multiple simultaneous power-ups of the same type
- Independent control schemes for each snake
- Changing snake colors or appearances beyond visual distinction

### Requirements

1. Split snakes spawn on level 10+ with 1% probability
2. Split effect lasts 6 seconds
3. Secondary snake mirrors primary snake's movements in opposite directions
4. Visual indicator: Primary snake remains green, secondary snake is blue
5. Both snakes can collect pellets
6. Colliding with either snake ends the game
7. Snakes merge back into one at power-up expiration

### Implementation Plan

1. Add gameState properties for split snake system
2. Implement split snake generation and spawning
3. Add collision detection for split snake power-up
4. Implement dual snake movement logic
5. Add visual drawing for both snakes
6. Implement timer system integration
7. Handle snake merging logic
8. Testing and balancing
