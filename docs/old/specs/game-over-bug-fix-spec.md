# Snake Game Over Bug Fix Specification

## 🎯 Purpose

Fix the bug where the snake continues to move and the game restarts automatically when the "Game Over" screen is displayed after pressing arrow keys.

## 📋 Core Lifecycle (7 Stages)

### 1. [x] Concept & Validation

**Purpose**: Validate idea with full context awareness, user-centric focus, and honest feasibility assessment
**Content**:

- [x] Problem statement with specific user needs, pain points, and evidence
    - When "Game Over" displays, the snake should not move anymore or be steered by arrow keys
    - Bug: Now it moves, and you can even gain level and die and then "Game Over" disappears and game continues normally
- [x] Core concept with clear value proposition and measurable outcomes
    - Prevent arrow key inputs from restarting the game when in game over state
