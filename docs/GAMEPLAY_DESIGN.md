    dx: 0,
    dy: 0, // Current direction vectors
    dxPrev: 0,
    dyPrev: 0, // Previous direction for collision handling

    // Progression systems
    score: 0, // Current score
    level: 1, // Current level (1 to ∞)

    // Environment systems
    maze: [[]], // 2D array for wall placement (0=path, 1=wall)
    pellets: [], // Array of collectible pellet positions
    trail: [], // Tron-inspired movement trail

## 🎮 **Revolutionary Gameplay Mechanics**

### **1. Secret Password-Based Level Progression System**

#### **🔐 Core Innovation**

#### **📊 Technical Implementation**

- **Secret Algorithm**: Deterministic generation ensures consistency
- **Character Set**: Alphanumeric passwords for security
- **Generation Frequency**: Passwords generated for levels divisible by 10 (10, 20, 30, etc.)
- **Real-time Input**: Type discovered passwords anytime during gameplay
- **No Storage Required**: Eliminates need for cookies/localStorage

#### **🎯 How It Works**

Unlike traditional level selection systems, this password system works as follows:

### **6. Tron-Inspired Trail System**

The snake leaves a temporary blue trail, creating visual feedback and additional collision challenges.

#### **⚡ Trail Mechanics**

- **Visual Effect**: Blue trail segments behind snake movement (rainbow during mushroom power-up)
- **Collision Detection**: Snake body segments cause bouncing behavior, while trail segments cause death and level loss
- **Self-Collision**: Running into snake body causes snake to bounce off in random directions, while running into trail causes death and level loss
- **Dynamic Clearing**: Trail doesn't persist indefinitely
- **Strategic Element**: Players must navigate their own path history

### **7. Respawn & Regression System**

#### **🔄 Forgiving Progression**

Death doesn't mean complete restart - it's a strategic regression system.

#### **📉 Respawn Rules**

- **Level Regression**: Drop to previous level (minimum level 1)
- **Score Reduction**: Lose 50% of current score
- **Snake Reduction**: Halve snake length (minimum 1 segment)
- **Randomized Respawn**: New starting position randomized
- **Maze Regeneration**: Fresh maze for regressed level

#### **🎯 Strategic Implications**

- **Risk Management**: Higher levels carry greater death penalties

**Status**: Complete Implementation Reference


## Game Over Behavior

The game over system works as follows:

1. When the snake collides with itself or a wall, the game over sequence is triggered
2. On Level 1, collisions result in a complete game over
3. On Levels 2+, players respawn at the previous level with:
   - Score reduced by half
   - Snake length reduced to 3 segments
   - Power-ups retained
4. This creates a forgiving progression system that encourages continued play



## Password System Behavior

The password system allows players to advance to specific levels:

1. Players can enter passwords at any time during gameplay
2. Valid passwords immediately advance the player to the corresponding level
3. The player's score is adjusted based on the target level
4. Previously collected power-ups are retained
5. Invalid passwords are ignored

This system provides a way for players to quickly access higher levels for replaying or skipping to challenging sections.



## Power-up Spawn Probabilities

The power-up spawning system has been carefully balanced to provide an engaging gameplay experience:

### Initial Spawn Rates (when a level is generated)
- **Mushroom**: 15% chance to appear
- **Lightning Bolt**: 2% chance to appear
- **Star**: 2% chance to appear
- **Hourglass**: 1% chance to appear

### Random Spawn Rates (during gameplay)
- **Mushroom**: 0.3% chance per game update
- **Lightning Bolt**: 0.6% chance per game update
- **Star**: 1.2% chance per game update
- **Hourglass**: 0.4% chance per game update

These probabilities create a tiered rarity system where Mushrooms are common, Lightning Bolts and Stars are uncommon, and Hourglasses are rare.
