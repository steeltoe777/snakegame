# Detailed Template (≤2000 tokens)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis for complex, high-value files. Maximum detail while maintaining token efficiency.

## Required Fields

### purpose (required)
- **Max tokens**: 200
- **Format**: Detailed explanation of file's role, responsibilities, and place in architecture
- **Focus**: What it does, why it's important, how it fits in the larger system
- **Include**: Main responsibilities, key behaviors, architectural significance

### keyTerms (required)
- **Max tokens**: 400
- **Format**: Comprehensive array of searchable terms, technologies, patterns, concepts (use FULL words)
- **Focus**: All terms that would help AI agents find and understand this file
- **Storage**: Full terms preserved in metadata - system automatically abbreviates for index display
- **Ordering**: **CRITICAL** - Order by importance (most essential terms first, index shows first 8 terms)
- **Priority Strategy**: Core function → Primary technology → Key patterns → Supporting technologies → Business domain
- **Include**: Technologies, frameworks, domain concepts, important functions, patterns, business terms
- **Example**: ["authentication", "jwt", "middleware", "security", "token-validation", "session-management", "express", "nodejs", "redis", "oauth"] (auth + jwt most critical)
- **Note**: Write full words like "authentication", "configuration", "database" - abbreviation (auth, config, db) happens automatically in the compact index

## Optional Fields (High Value)

### dependencies (optional)
- **Max tokens**: 200
- **Format**: Comprehensive list of imports with purposes
- **Focus**: External libraries, internal modules, their roles
- **Include**: Why each dependency is used
- **Example**: ["jsonwebtoken - JWT token generation and validation", "../models/User - User data structure and validation"]

### patterns (optional)
- **Max tokens**: 400
- **Format**: Detailed architectural patterns, design decisions, conventions
- **Focus**: How the code is structured and why
- **Include**: Design patterns, architectural choices, conventions followed
- **Example**: ["Middleware pattern for request processing", "Factory pattern for token generation", "Strategy pattern for different auth methods"]

### aiGuidance (optional)
- **Max tokens**: 300
- **Format**: Specific guidance for AI agents working with this code
- **Focus**: How to use, modify, or extend this code
- **Include**: Common use cases, gotchas, best practices
- **Example**: "When modifying authentication logic, ensure all token validations use the same secret. Always update refresh token logic alongside access token changes."

### errorHandling (optional)
- **Max tokens**: 200
- **Format**: Array of error scenarios and handling strategies
- **Focus**: What can go wrong and how it's handled
- **Include**: Error types, recovery strategies, fallbacks
- **Example**: ["Invalid token - returns 401 with clear error message", "Database connection failure - falls back to cached validation"]

### integrationPoints (optional)
- **Max tokens**: 200
- **Format**: Key integration points with other systems
- **Focus**: How this file connects to external services, databases, APIs
- **Include**: External dependencies, communication protocols
- **Example**: ["Redis for session storage", "Auth0 for social login", "Database for user persistence"]

### relatedContexts (optional)
- **Max tokens**: 100
- **Format**: Array of closely related files with relationship descriptions
- **Focus**: Files that work together or should be understood together
- **Include**: Nature of relationship
- **Example**: ["middleware/cors.ts - Sets up CORS before auth", "routes/auth.ts - Uses this middleware"]

### complexity (optional)
- **Max tokens**: 5
- **Format**: Single value from: low, medium, high
- **Focus**: Logical/cognitive complexity of content, NOT file size
- **Low**: Simple utilities, basic configs, straightforward documentation
- **Medium**: Standard business logic, moderate abstractions, typical service classes
- **High**: Complex algorithms, intricate state machines, advanced architectural patterns
- **Assessment**: Consider conceptual difficulty, abstraction levels, interdependencies

## Analysis Guidelines

1. **Comprehensive coverage**: Include all important aspects of the file
2. **AI-centric perspective**: Focus on information that helps AI understand and work with the code  
3. **Practical details**: Include specifics that would be needed for modification or debugging
4. **Architecture awareness**: Explain how this fits into the larger system
5. **Error scenarios**: Cover what can go wrong and how it's handled
6. **Integration focus**: Explain how this connects to other parts of the system
7. **Search optimization**: keyTerms will be compressed in the compact index - include both full and abbreviated forms
8. **Priority awareness**: High complexity files appear first in the AI index - make analysis comprehensive
9. **Term prioritization**: Order keyTerms strategically - most critical for finding this file come first

## When to Use
- **Complex source files**: Core business logic, main application files
- **High-complexity rating**: Files marked as "high" complexity
- **Large files**: Files with >2000 estimated tokens
- **Critical components**: Authentication, payment processing, core APIs
- **Integration hubs**: Files that connect many other parts of the system
